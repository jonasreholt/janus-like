% What is reversable languages?
\section{Introduction}
Reversible programming languages allow the programmer to write programs, that can be run
both forward and backwards. Getting this ability into a language impacts the basic structure
such that assignments, conditional operations, and loops must be handled in another way
than traditional languages do. The reversibility of the programs does however have the benefits
of:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Lowering side-channel attack, as it does not constantly delete memory to make room for
    new information [FIND CITATION], thereby creating programs that generates a more constant
    stream of heat.

    \item Removing the theoretical lower limit of heat generation [FIND CITATION], making way
    for lowering the energy usage of computers (This does however require computers build
    for reversibility).

    \item Models the world of physics more precise, as physics in itself is reversible
    [FIND CITATION].

    \item Only needing to write one program, when functionality such as zip/unzip, that has
    a natural inversion that you want. This allows the programmer to write one program, prove
    correctness of one program, and then ship "two" programs.
\end{itemize}
\noindent
This project focuses on the last item for two reasons: 1) that the majority of computers today are
not reversible, and 2) that translating from a reversible language to an irreversible
generates certain overhead, as i.e. \texttt{if}-statements need both an entering condition and an
exiting assertion for reversibility; meaning the program needs to check an extra assertion each
time an \texttt{if}-statement is run.


\subsection{Boundaries}
The focus of this project is on finding whether a theorem prover is available for making static
program analyse in compile time, checking whether these extra assertions can be removed. Hence
there will be no other focus on optimization in the code generation

Also as this is a bachelor thesis the focus will be on freely available theorem provers.
