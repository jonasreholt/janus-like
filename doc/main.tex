% Focus on the report now
% Interesting things are whatever goes beyond IPS course curriculum
% The uninteresting things needs to be mentioned, but no theory discussion for it!!

% In frontend only mention unconventional thing

% 4.3:
% Why on earth am I reversing the AST
% And how am I reversing (recursive descend)
%   How it happens precisely
% Setting it together with the overall approach of removing assertions.

% Use more code snippet in everything "new" e.g. loops


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Internal trial exam where I just present the presentation, to try out the timing

% Exam room: HCØ A106 "A106 at HCØ for the thesis defenses on June 21"

% Benchmark:
%            If one had more examples one could say: In this "diverse" set of programs, that
%            cover the different analysis cases, it works like this for nested conditionals,
%            and so forth. So it should be more about analytical overview of what it can do
%            and what it cannot, and not so much about runtime. So highlight some cases where
%            it could not be removed, show that it possibly could be easily fixed.
%           So ite, for unrollable, for generalized, nested conditional and so forth.
%           Did the unroll work well, do my
%           generalization work? Can stuff be "fixed" easily by handcrafted assertions.


% Maybe add a flag to chose loop bound. Add a micropoint to why 100 was used as default

% 3.2.2: Either expand it with concrete examples of the API, or mix it with another section.
