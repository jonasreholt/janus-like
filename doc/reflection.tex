Should have used \texttt{Boogie 2}

Another tool for analyzing and verifying properties of \lan programs, could have been the use
of an intermediate language, that uses tools such as mentioned above, to perform optimization
runs on the intermediate code. \texttt{Boogie 2} is such a tool. It is an intermediate
language representation, that uses the SMT solver \texttt{z3} to verify the program \cite{boogey}.
