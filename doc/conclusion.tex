\section{Conclusion \ms}
% Possibly "future work"
Further work:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Recursive procedures.
    \item Checking if other approach mentioned under compiler section is faster.
    \item Handling procedures calling each other endlessly not resulting in infinite loop
          for optimizer.
    \item Convert grammar into LL(1).
    \item Better loop termination technique.
    \item Invalidation should merely generalize variables, meaning remove any known information
          from it.
    \item Make loop unroll check also check whether the local int is the same being modified,
          and deallocated.
\end{itemize}
